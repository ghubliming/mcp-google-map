Let me help you understand when this error response occurs in the project. Looking at the code, this specific error message appears in the `geocode` method of the `PlacesSearcher` class.

Let me search for more context about how this is used.

Based on the code analysis, the error message "Error occurred while converting address to coordinates" will be returned in several scenarios:

1. When using the `geocode` method in the `PlacesSearcher` class, this error occurs when:
   - The Google Maps API call fails
   - The address provided is invalid or cannot be found
   - There are network connectivity issues
   - The Google Maps API key is invalid or missing

2. The error is specifically returned in the `geocode` method of `PlacesSearcher` class when:
   ```typescript
   async geocode(address: string): Promise<GeocodeResponse> {
     try {
       const result = await this.mapsTools.geocode(address);
       return {
         success: true,
         data: result,
       };
     } catch (error) {
       return {
         success: false,
         error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Error occurred while converting address to coordinates",
       };
     }
   }
   ```

3. This error is used in the API endpoint handler in `index.ts` when the geocoding operation fails:
   ```typescript
   if (!result.success) {
     return {
       content: [{ type: "text", text: result.error || "Failed to convert address to coordinates" }],
       isError: true,
     };
   }
   ```

The error will be returned in the format you showed:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Error occurred while converting address to coordinates",
    "annotations": null
  }
]
```

This happens when:
1. The address provided is invalid or cannot be found by Google Maps
2. There are issues with the Google Maps API (like API key problems or rate limiting)
3. Network connectivity issues prevent the API call from succeeding
4. The Google Maps API returns an error response

To avoid this error, you should:
1. Ensure you have a valid Google Maps API key
2. Provide valid, well-formatted addresses
3. Check your network connectivity
4. Monitor your API usage to stay within rate limits
